**Basic Idea**: The main product is a website in which you navigate a menu of options of what should the graph look like, then upload a picture, then the backend uses machine learning to find the best fit for the graph .  Then it will output the graph with the points and fitted equation, also it will show the equation of the graph. 

The intro page will tell about the website and will have a menu option on which _line fit to use_, it will have an option of a straight line. and the rest of the options for now will be inspired by my chem exp, so make one labelled physical exp.1 in which i need to fit a graph of concenteration vs surface tension, and the purpose of it is to find CMC . We will design the backend for this later.
